# Air Quality Monitor using Arduino UNO R3

This project uses Arduino hardware as a controller and sensors for detecting monoxide gas, as well as a temperature and humidity sensor, along with a 5-volt buzzer and an I2C OLED screen. Also also can use the Tera Term program to save the data you receive from the Arduino. Tera Term is a terminal program that allows you to connect to the Arduino serial port and display the incoming data.
