# Arduino-Projects

In this project, I tried to model the object detection radar on a conceptual scale.
This project uses Arduino platform as controller,
ultrasonic sensor as object detection, servo motor to rotate ultrasonic sensor. You can use a bracket to install the ultrasonic sensor on the servo motor.
Also, by using Procasing 3 program, the performed scan is displayed graphically.
